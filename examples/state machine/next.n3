# - given a sequential relation, if the prior entity is complete, then ready the following entity  

{	?e1 :next ?e2 . # sequential relation between ?e1 and ?e2
	?e1 state:in :Completed . # completed prior entity
	
	{ ?e2 state:in :Inactive } # following entity in inactive state
		e:becomes
			{ ?e2 state:in :Ready }

} => { ?e2 state:in :Ready } .


# - simple test
