		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The Semantic Web represents a vision of online, interconnected and logical information. The core building block is a logical formalism called the Resource Description Framework (RDF) ([[[RDF11-PRIMER]]]). In RDF, one can express a logical graph as a conjunction of statements that describe properties of subject resources; and then describe the resource objects of those properties; and so on; resulting in a connected graph of logical information. It builds on the fundamental pointer mechanism of the Web, i.e., the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), also known as International Resource Identifier (<abbr title="International Resource Identifier">IRI</abbr>), as a means to identify any RDF resource, ranging from abstract concepts (the book "Moby Dick") to physical (a paper copy of the book "Moby Dick") to electronic objects (an e-book copy of "Moby Dick"). People have used RDF to build vast quantities of online, connected knowledge graphs. The Semantic Web has allowed for decision making within an open web environment of shared knowledge graphs, as opposed to a closed system of locally believed facts.</p>

		<p>Notation3 Logic, or N3 for short, aims to improve decision-making abilities in an open web environment - by (a) extending the logical representation abilities of RDF and (b) allowing to access, operate on, and reason over online information. In line with the design ethos of RDF, N3 attempts to walk the line between, on the one hand, ease-of-use by authors and simplicity of reasoning for developers; and, on the other hand, an extended utility and practicality for building real-world applications.</p>
		
		<p>Below, we elaborate on the main characteristics of N3:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>N3 is a superset of RDF and <abbr title="Terse RDF Triple Language">Turtle</abbr>.</b> One can write any valid [[[turtle]]] graph and it will be valid in N3 as well. Importantly, this means that all of Turtle's syntactic sugar is available in N3 - including predicate and object lists, unlabeled blank nodes, and collections. Moreover, <b>collections are first-class citizens</b> in N3, with an associated set of built-ins for accessing and manipulating them.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>N3 adds an If-Then style of decision making in the form of logical implications and variables.</b> Logical implications allow making If-Then style inferences via modus ponens (where implementations may apply either backward- or forward-chaining). Variables in such rules may be either universally or existentially quantified - in the latter case, they are comparable to blank nodes. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>N3 supports quoting and describing graphs of statements (e.g., recording provenance).</b> In an open web environment, as an unbounded sea of (semi-)connected sources, one should be made aware of, and given the ability to disseminate, the provenance of information, among others. A quoted graph includes a conjunction of quoted statements. It allows expressing where the particular statements (e.g., message, document) came from, at what time they were stated and by whom, and, in general, what other kinds of statements can be made about them.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>N3 includes a core set of builtins for accessing remote online information.</b> In an open web environment, any online source may have information to support decision making. The <code>log:semantics</code> builtin allows pulling in (parsed) logical expressions from remote online locations; the <code>log:conclusion</code> built-in allows calculating the deductive closure of any logical expression, albeit local or remote. Subsequently, down-stream operations may, for instance, check whether other expressions are included, or not included, within these logical expressions.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>N3 supports a scoped version of negation-as-failure.</b> In an open web environment, it is often useful to check whether online information supports or not, or allows to derive or not, a given set of facts. But, it will not be possible nor useful to check whether the whole Semantic Web <i>does not</i> support a given set of facts at some time - any online source, unknown to the reasoner at the time, or added after the question was asked, may hold a positive answer. Instead, a useful question in this setting is whether a <i>specific</i> piece of information, at a given point in time, does not support, or does not allow the derivation of, a set of facts. When tightly scoped to a specific information source, and at a specific time, this kind of negation-as-failure will not influenced by other, unknown online sources. This is referred to as scoped negation as failure, and is supported by N3's <code>log:notIncludes</code> built-in. </p>

	  <h2>Language</h2>
      <p>The aim of this section is to provide an informal overview of the N3 language and its different features. Where possible, this section borrows from, or is at least based on, the [[[turtle]]] specification</a>. More formal definitions will follow in the subsequent sections.
      </p>

		<h3>N3 document</h3>
		<p>An N3 document represents an N3 graph in a compact textual form. An N3 graph, in its simplest form, is a series of <a href="#simpletriples">N3 statements</a>, each describing a resource's property and written as a triple: <code>&lt;subject&gt; &lt;predicate&gt; &lt;object&gt;.</code> An N3 graph can have many more elements - <a href="#cformulas">cited formulas</a> for quoting sets of statements, <a href="#logimpl">logical implications</a> for If-Then style, rule-based reasoning, <a href="#variables">quantifications</a> for variables, and so on. We introduce these elements below.</p>
		
		<p>Comments are indicated using a separate '#' (i.e., not part of another N3 symbol, such as an IRI) and continue until the end of 
		the line.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section id='simpletriples'>
	  
	  <h4>Simple triples</h4>
	  
	  <p>The simplest N3 statement or triple is a sequence of <code>&lt;subject&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;predicate&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>, separated by whitespace and terminated by '<code>.</code>' after each triple. For now, we will asssume that a resource is represented either by an <a href="#iris">IRI</a> or a <a href="#literals">literal</a>. In general, one uses an IRI to identify, well, an identifiable entity, such as a person, place, or thing &mdash; and a literal for a textual or numerical (i.e., datatype) value, such as names, dates, height, and so on.
	  
	  <p>The three N3 statements below highlights the emnity between Spiderman and the Green Goblin, and lists the names of these two individuals:</p>

	<!-- 
		NOTE: there is a data-include attribute 
		(https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/ReSpec-Editor's-Guide#inclusions--transformations)

	  &lt;http://example.org/#green-goblin&gt; &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name&gt; "Green Goblin" .
	  </pre>

      <p class="note">Examples will often be written using newlines and tab spaces for readability. However, generally, only the subjects, predicates and objects need to be separated with a whitespace.</p>

      </section>
      <section id='polists'>
        <h4>Predicate and object lists</h4>
        <p>As shown in the above example, the same subject (e.g., Spiderman) will often be described by several N3 statements. To make these N3 statements less cumbersome, one can put a '<code>;</code>' at the end of an N3 statement to describe the same subject in the subsequent N3 statement (called a "predicate list"):</p>
        <pre class="example nohighlight">
	  &lt;http://example.org/#spiderman&gt; &lt;http://example.org/#enemyOf&gt; &lt;http://example.org/#green-goblin&gt; ;
				&lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name&gt; "Spiderman" .

          &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/lastName&gt; &quot;Tomaszuk&quot; .</pre> -->
        <p>Similarly, a predicate (e.g., name) can often list multiple object values for the same subject (e.g., Spiderman). This can be written by listing the object values separated by a '<code>,</code>':</p>
        <pre class="example nohighlight">
	  &lt;http://example.org/#spiderman&gt; 
				&lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name&gt; "Spiderman", "Peter Parker" .

      </section>
      <section id='iris'>
        <h3><abbr title="International Resource Identifiers">IRIs</a></h3>
        As mentioned, one typically uses an IRI to represent an identifiable entity - such as a person, place, or thing. Until now, we have been writing <dfn id="dfn-absolute-iri">absolute IRIs</dfn> (e.g., <code>http://example.org/#Spiderman</code>) - IRIs that include both the namespace (e.g., <code>http://example.org/#</code>) and the local name (e.g., <code>Spiderman</code>).</p>
        <p>This is a perfectly valid way of writing IRIs, but it is often much easier to write an IRI as a <dfn id="dfn-prefixed-name">prefixed name</dfn> - e.g., <code>ex:Spiderman</code>, which includes a <dfn id="dfn-prefix-label">prefix label</dfn> (e.g., <code>ex</code>) and a <dfn id="dfn-local-name">local name</dfn> (e.g., <code>Spiderman</code>) separated by a colon '<code>:</code>'. The <code>'@prefix'</code> directive associates a prefix label with a namespace IRI - a prefixed name is turned into an IRI by concatenating the namespace IRI of the prefix label with the local name. For instance, the following is equivalent to using absolute IRIs:</p>
        <pre class="example nohighlight">
			@prefix ex: &lt;http://www.example.org/#&gt; .
			ex:green-goblin ex:enemyOf ex:spiderman .
		</pre>
        <p>To further simplify prefixed names, one can leave the prefix label empty (e.g., for a namespace that is often used in the N3 document):</p>
        <pre class="example nohighlight">
			@prefix : &lt;http://www.example.org/#&gt; .
			:green-goblin :enemyOf :spiderman .
		</pre>
        <p>One can write <dfn id="dfn-relative-iri">relative IRIs</dfn>, e.g., <code>&lt;#Spiderman&gt;</code>, which will be resolved relative to the <i>current base IRI</i>. In other words, a relative IRI is turned into an IRI by concatenating the base IRI with the local name (e.g., <code>Spiderman</code>). A base IRI can be defined using the '@base' directive. For instance, the following is equivalent to the prior example:</p>
        <pre class="example nohighlight">
			@base &lt;http://www.example.org/#&gt; .
			&lt;#green-goblin&gt; &lt;#enemyOf&gt; &lt;#spiderman&gt; .
		</pre>
		
		<p class="note">We recommend listing the @prefix declarations (just like @base declarations) at the top of an N3 document. This is not mandatory however, and they can technically be put anywhere before the prefixed name or relative IRI that relies on the declaration. Subsequent '@prefix' or 'PREFIX' directives may re-map the same prefix label to another namespace IRI.</p>
			
		<p class="note">N3 also supports case-insensitive 'PREFIX' and 'BASE' directives, as does Turtle, to align the syntax with SPARQL. Note that the <code>@prefix</code> and <code>@base</code> directives require a trailing '<code>.</code>' after the IRI, but the equivalent<code>PREFIX</code> and <code>BASE</code> must not have a trailing '.'.
		</p>

		<p class="note">Specifics of relative IRI resolution are defined in <a data-cite="TURTLE#sec-iri-references">the Turtle spec</a>.</p>

	<h3>Literals</h3>
	<p>In general, one uses a literal to represent a textual or numerical (i.e., datatype) value - such as names, dates, height, and so on. Numbers (integers, decimals and doubles) can simply be represented using their numerical value, and booleans can be represented using keywords <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>:</p>
	
	<pre class="example nohighlight">
		@prefix : &lt;http://example.org/elements&gt; .                                                                          
		&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium&gt;                                                                                 
				:atomicNumber 2 ;               # xsd:integer                                                                      
				:atomicMass 4.002602 ;          # xsd:decimal                                                                      
				:specificGravity 1.663E-4 .     # xsd:double
				:isNobleGas true . 		# xsd:boolean
	</pre>
	
	<p>For details on what number syntax is supported (e.g., for decimals, doubles), we refer to the <a data-cite="TURTLE#abbrev">RDF 1.1: Turtle (Section 2.5.2)</a> specification.</p>
    
	<p>Other literals (e.g., date; binary, octal or hex code; XML or JSON code; other types of numbers, such as shorts), and of course strings themselves, need to be written as string literals. For instance:
    
	<pre class="example nohighlight">
	  &lt;http://example.org/#spiderman&gt; &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name&gt; "Spiderman" ;
				&lt;http://example.org/#birthDate&gt; "2001-08-10" .
	</pre>
	
	<p>In that case, the <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-lexical-form">"RDF lexical form"</a> will include the characters between the delimiter quotes (e.g., <code>2001-08-10</code>). Clearly, this can raise confusion as to what type of literal is being represented - a string or some other arbitrary type. RDF allows indicating the datatype of a literal, using the <code>^^</code> symbol and the corresponding <a data-cite="XMLSCHEMA11-2#built-in-datatypes">datatype IRI</a> - for instance: <code>"2001-08-10"^^&lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date&gt;</code>. One can also use a prefixed name <code>xsd:date</code>, given a suitable prefix declaration (see <a href="#string-literal-example">example</a>).</p>
	
	<p>In lieu of a datatype, one can specify the language of a string literal using the "<code>@</code>" symbol and the corresponding language tag (as defined in [[BCP47]] - find the registry in [[LNG-TAG]]). For instance:</p>
	
	<pre class="example nohighlight">
	  &lt;http://example.org/#spiderman&gt; &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name&gt; "Spiderman"@en , 
					"Hombre Araña"@es , "Homme Araignée"@fr .
	</pre>
	
	<p class="note">If no datatype IRI or language tag is given, the datatype <code>xsd:string</code> will be assumed. In case a language tag is given, the datatype <code>rdf:langString</code> will be assumed. Note that it is not possible to specify both a datatype IRI and a language tag.</p>
	<p class="note">Integers, decimals and doubles, or booleans, may also be written as string literals with the appropriate datatype IRI. Boolean literals can be written as <code>true</code> or <code>@true</code> and <code>false</code> or <code>@false</code>.</p>
	
	There are several ways to write string literals. Until now we have used double-quotes <code>"</code> for delimiting, but one may also use single-quotes <code>'</code>, or even compound delimiters consisting of three double-quotes <code>"""</code> or three single-quotes <code>'''</code>. These other delimiters are useful if the string literal is known to contain single- or double-quotes; e.g., if the string contains single-quotes, one could use double-quotes as delimiters, and vice-versa, to avoid syntax errors. Alternatively, one can also use a '<code>\</code>' for escaping the delimiter each time it occurs within a string literal. If a string can contain newlines (or a quote of any type, and it is impractical or undesirable to escape them), one should use the compound type of delimiter, i.e., <code>"""</code> or <code>'''</code>. For instance:
	
	<pre id="string-literal-example" class="example nohighlight">@prefix ex: &lt;http://example.org/#&gt; .
@prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt; .
@prefix xsd: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt; .

ex:Spiderman rdfs:label "'Bitten' by a radioactive spider."^^&lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string%gt; . # literal with XML Schema string datatype
ex:Spiderman rdfs:label '"Bitten" by a radioactive spider.'^^xsd:string .	# same as above
ex:Spiderman rdfs:label """'Bitten' by "what"?
	A radioactive spider!"""^^xsd:string
	</pre>
        <p>In general, the escape symbol '<code>\</code>' (<span class="codepoint">U+005C</span>) may only appear in a string literal as part of <a href="#escseq">an escape sequence</a>. Other restrictions within string literals depend on the delimiter:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Literals delimited by <code>'</code> (<span class="codepoint">U+0027</span>), may not contain the characters <code>'</code>, <code title="LINE FEED"><sub>LF</sub></code> (<span class="codepoint">U+000A</span>), or <code title="CARRIAGE RETURN"><sub>CR</sub></code> (<span class="codepoint">U+000D</span>).
          </li>
          <li>Literals delimited by <code>&quot;</code>, may not contain the characters <code>&quot;</code>, <code title="LINE FEED"><sub>LF</sub></code>, or <code title="CARRIAGE RETURN"><sub>CR</sub></code>.
          </li>
          <li>Literals delimited by <code>'''</code> may not contain the sequence of characters <code>'''</code>.
          </li>
          <li>Literals delimited by <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;</code> may not contain the sequence of characters <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;</code>.</li>

        <h3>Blank Nodes</h3>
        <p>In many cases, it would be quite inconvenient and redundant to mint a new IRI each time one wants to describe a resource. Such a unique identification is useful when one wants external N3 graphs to refer to the resource, but quite redundant otherwise.
		
		Instead, one can instead use blank nodes to talk about resources. Blank nodes are not really "anonymous resources", i.e., resources without an IRI, but rather existential variables, i.e., they state the existence of a thing without identifying that thing.
		
		(unknown resource use case) [rdf-primer#section-blank-node]
		For instance, we might want to state that the Mona Lisa painting has in its background an unidentified tree which we know to be a cypress tree. We could mint an IRI such as "mona-lisa-cypress-tree" but that would be awkward and redundant. Especially because we simply want to describe the tree, such as the painting it is in, and the type of tree, and we're not very interested in allowing other N3 graphs to refer to the tree. Instead, we can simply use a blank node to represent the resource, which can be represented in several ways:
		
			<section id='bnodeids'>
			<h4>Blank node identifiers</h4>
			A blank node can be represented by a locally unique blank node identifier, i.e., only unique within the N3 graph. This identifier looks as follows: ..
			
			Then, we use this identifier to describe the resource in the same way we have been doing until now. For instance: ..
			
			(composite information structuring) (https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/#structuredproperties)
			A common use case for blank nodes is when describing composite or aggregate pieces of information, in such a way that explicitly lists their components. Such as street addresses, telephone numbers and dates. 
			
			It would be quite redundant to introduce an IRI just for the purpose of structuring this information: ..
			Indeed, it is unlikely that anyone outside this N3 graph would ever need to refer directly to an IRI "".
			Instead, one can use an RDF blank node to connect the "composed" piece of information, such as a street address, and its composite values. 
			If there is an expectation that the entity, e.g., street address, will need to be referenced from outside the graph, one should use an IRI for identifying the entity.
			
			(n-ary relations)
			Thirdly, as discussed later on, blank nodes are a way to represent <a href="#naryrel">n-ary relations in N3</a>.
			</section>
			
			<section id='bnodeprplist'>
			<h4>Blank node property lists</h4>
			Above, we used blank node identifiers as a way to make statements about blank nodes. However, and although they're not quite as hard to mint as IRIs, it is redundant in most cases to even introduce such an identifier. 
			
			As mentioned above, blank nodes are often used to structure composite information, or represent n-ary relations. In those cases, the resulting N3 graphs will be quite similar; a statement linking a subject (e.g., "john") to a blank node object (e.g., a street address, purchase relation, ..), and a series of subsequent statements describing the blank node. 
		
			These cases can be written much more conveniently as follows: ...
			
			NOTE in some cases, using a blank node identifier will simply feel more convenient and natural. For instance, in case multiple people have the same address, and one wants to use the pattern described above, one would need to repeat the address description for each person sharing the address. Alternatively, one can of course use an inverse addressOf property to link all people sharing the same address, but this may not feel natural to some.

      <h2>Syntactic Concepts and Terminology</h2>
      <p> 
        In this section we give an overview of the syntax of <abbr title="Notation3">N3</abbr>.
        <abbr title="Notation3">N3</abbr> is an extension of RDF. We use the following concepts from the [[[RDF11-CONCEPTS]]]: <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#section-IRIs">IRI</a>, <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#section-triples">RDF triple</a>, <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#section-rdf-graph">RDF graph</a>, <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#section-triples">subject</a>, <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#section-triples">predicate</a>, <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#section-triples">object</a>, <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-source">RDF source</a>, <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-node">node</a>, <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-blank-node">blank node</a>, <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-literal">literal</a>,  <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#graph-isomorphism">isomorphic</a>, and <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#section-generalized-rdf">generalized RDF triples, graphs, and datasets</a>. </p>
      <p>
        The examples above as well as the examples in the remainder of this document all follow <abbr title="Notation3">N3</abbr>-turtle syntax which is also the standard syntax for <abbr title="Notation3">N3</abbr>. 
        It is however possible, to use alternative syntaxes as long as the translation to <abbr title="Notation3">N3</abbr> turtle syntax is clearly defined.

        <h3>Terms</h3>
        <p>
          In order to define the set of all terms of <abbr title="Notation3">N3</abbr> we to add several definitions to the RDF concepts above which extend the syntax of RDF to <abbr title="Notation3">N3</abbr>: 
        </p>
        <p>
        The set of <dfn id="dfn-n3-symbols">N3 symbols</dfn> consists of the set of <a href="#dfn-triple-elements">N3 triple elements</a> and the 
        <a href="#dfn-quantifiers">quantifiers</a> which are defined below.
        </p>
       <p>
       The set of <dfn id="dfn-triple-elements">N3 triple elements</dfn> consists of the disjoint sets of <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-iri">IRIs</a>, 
       <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-blank-node">blank nodes</a>, <a data-cite="RDF11-CONCEPTS#dfn-literal">literals</a>, 
       <a href="#universals">universal variables</a>, lists, quoted graphs  and of one implication sign. The latter is a special symbol to indicate an implication. In N3-turtle syntax sign is represented using the symbol <code>=&gt;</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The set of <dfn id="dfn-quantifiers">N3 quantifiers</dfn> consists of the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier. In <abbr title="Notation3">N3</abbr>-turtle 
          syntax we denote the universal quantifier as <code>@forAll</code> and the existential quantifier as <code>@forSome</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The set of <dfn id="universals">universal variables</dfn> is an arbitrary set of symbols which is disjoint to all other <abbr title="Notation3">N3</abbr> triple elements. 
          In <abbr title="Notation3">N3</abbr>-turtle syntax, universal variables are represented by strings starting with a question mark <code>?</code>.

      <h2><abbr title="Extended Backus–Naur Form">EBNF</abbr> Grammar</h2>
      <p>The <a data-cite="TURTLE#sec-grammar-grammar">Turtle grammar</a> was used as the starting point for the N3 grammar, which was subsequently adapted and extended with N3 constructs.</p>
	  <p>The N3 Working Group made the following decisions that modify the N3 grammar as originally presented in [[N3]]:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Dropping the <code>@keywords</code> declaration. It is complex and difficult to explain. Also, when using the declaration, N3 documents look wholly different from when it is not being used, since it allows local names in the default namespace to be listed without the "<code>:</code>" symbol.
			</li>
			<li>
				Supporting all verb and boolean keywords (<code>is .. of</code>, <code>has</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>) both with and without "<code>@</code>" prefix. Turtle supports the <code>a</code> keyword, i.e., without an "<code>@</code>", but requires the symbol for the <code>@prefix</code> and <code>@base</code> declarations. The original N3 grammar required the "<code>@</code>" prefix for all verb and boolean keywords. Hence, this decision was made for compatibility with Turtle as well as to avoid an unintuitive grammar, i.e., where some keywords have the "<code>@</code>" prefix and some don't.
			</li>
			<li>
				Representing an inverted property using the <code>^</code> symbol. The original N3 grammar allowed the inverting of a property by using the <code>@is .. @of</code> construct. But, this construct can be unintuitive when property names are more verbosely specified (e.g., <code>:hasFather</code>), leading to statements such as <code>?x @is :hasFather @of ?y</code>. The <code>@is .. @of</code> construct is still supported, but the above statement can now be represented as follows: <code>?x ^:hasFather ?y</code>. This is also in line with the <a data-cite="sparql11-query#propertypaths">SPARQL 1.1 Property Path</a> syntax.
			</li>
		</ul>

	  <section id='comments'>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p>Comments are indicated using a "<code>#</code>" symbol outside an N3 terminal (e.g., <a href="#grammar-production-IRIREF">IRIREF</a>, <a href="#grammar-production-STRING">STRING</a>) and will continue until the end of the line (indicated by <code>\r</code>, <code>\n</code> or <code>\f</code>) or end of file, if there is no end of line marker.</p>

					(see the <a href="#grammar-production-ECHAR">ECHAR</a> production)

        <h3>IRI resolution</h3>
        <p> Relative IRIs are resolved with base IRIs using the algorithm in the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Generic Syntax [[RFC3986]] Section 5.2, "Relative Resolution". Since [[RFC3986]] pertains to URIs instead of IRIs, in the aforementioned algorithm, characters that are additionally allowed in IRI references are simply treated in the same way that unreserved characters are treated in URI references, per Section 6.5 of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [[RFC3987]]. Neither Syntax-Based Normalization nor Scheme-Based Normalization (described in Sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 of [[RFC3986]]) are performed.</p>
		
		<p>In descending order of precedence, the following describes how Base IRIs are established:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The N3 <code>@base</code> or <code>BASE</code> directive can be used to define the Base IRI, per [[RFC3986]] Section 5.1.1, "Base URI Embedded in Content".
			</li>
			<li>
				If no Base IRI is embedded: if the N3 document's retrieval context is known, then the enclosing entity's (e.g., message or archive) Base IRI will be used, as per [[RFC3986]] Section 5.1.2, "Base URI from the Encapsulating Entity". A mechanism for embedding a Base IRI within MIME container types is defined by MHTML [RFC2557] Section 5, "Base URIs for resolution of relative URIs". For instance, the HTML BASE directive or Content-Location header can be used within a MIME multipart container, as per [[RFC2557]], or the XML BASE directive within a SOAP envelope [[XMLBASE]].
			</li>
			<li>
				If no Base IRI is embedded, and no encapsulated entity exists: if a IRI was used to retrieve the N3 document, then that IRI will be considered the Base IRI, as per [[RFC3986]] Section 5.1.3, "Base URI from the Retrieval URI".
			</li>
			<li>If none of the above apply, then the Base IRI will be defined by the context of the application, as per [[RFC3986]] Section 5.1.4, "Default Base URI".</li>

		<h3>Relation with Turtle</h3>
		<p>N3 is a superset of [[[turtle]]], meaning that all valid Turtle documents will be valid in N3 as well. The inverse is not true, i.e., a valid N3 document will not always be valid in Turtle.</p>
		<p>The current N3 grammar started from the <a data-cite="TURTLE#sec-grammar">Turtle grammar</a> which was adapted and extended to be in line with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/grammar/n3-report.html">initial N3 grammar</a>. Hence, many of the grammar productions will be much more similar to the Turtle grammar than the initial N3 grammar.</p>
		<p>Important differences with Turtle are the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Literals are allowed at any s/p/o position (i.e., subject, predicate or object) in a statement. See the <a href="#grammar-production-pathItem">pathItem</a> production, which is (eventually) referenced by the "subject", "predicate" and "object" productions.</li>
			<li>Cited formulas (i.e., between "<code>{</code>" and "<code>}</code>"), which are allowed in any s/p/o position in a statement. See the <a href="#grammar-production-pathItem">pathItem</a> production.</li>
			<li>Quick-variables (e.g., "<code>?x</code>"), which are allowed in any s/p/o position in a statement. See the <a href="#grammar-production-pathItem">pathItem</a> production.</li>
			<li>Variable quantifications (e.g., "<code>@forAll :x .</code>"), which are a standalone element (i.e., not part of a "regular" N3 statement). See the <a href="#grammar-production-existential">existential</a> and <a href="#grammar-production-universal">universal</a> productions.</li>
			<li>A path syntax, comparable to (but not quite as extensive as) the <a data-cite="sparql11-query#propertypaths">SPARQL 1.1 Property Path</a> syntax. See the <a href="#grammar-production-path">path</a> production.</li>
			<li>The possibility to invert the predicate within a statement. See the <a href="#grammar-production-predicate">predicate</a> production.</li>
			<li>An additional set of keywords, incl. "<code>is .. of</code>", "<code>has</code>", "<code>=</code>", "<code>=></code>", "<code><=</code>", in addition to Turtle's "<code>a</code>" keyword (among others). All keywords can be optionally preceded by "<code>@</code>", for consistency with the "<code>@prefix</code>" and "<code>@base"</code> keywords.</li>

		<h3>Relation with TriG</h3>
		<p>[[[TRIG]]] is itself a superset of the Turtle syntax and includes a compact way to write RDF datasets, i.e., sets of named graphs. In particular, TriG allows the specification of so-called graph statements, which are a pair of an IRI or blank node label and a group of triple statements surrounded by "<code>{</code>" and "<code>}</code>".</p>

		<p>For instance: 
		
		<pre class="example nohighlight">
# This document contains a default graph and two named graphs.

@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .
@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt; .
@prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt; .

# default graph
&lt;http://example.org/bob&gt; dc:publisher "Bob" .
&lt;http://example.org/alice&gt; dc:publisher "Alice" .

&lt;http://example.org/bob&gt;
    {
       _:a foaf:name "Bob" .
       _:a foaf:mbox &lt;mailto:bob@oldcorp.example.org&gt; .
       _:a foaf:knows _:b .
    }

&lt;http://example.org/alice&gt;
    {
       _:b foaf:name "Alice" .
       _:b foaf:mbox &lt;mailto:alice@work.example.org&gt; .
    }	
</pre>
      <p>N3 is not directly compatible with TriG as it does not support this graph statement notation. Nevertheless, since N3 supports quoted graphs (i.e., cited formulas) as part of regular N3 statements, authors can utilize the N3 Named Graphs extension [<b>X</b>] for associating names or identifiers with cited formulas. Although applications could easily introduce their own custom predicates for this purpose, we strongly recommend the use of this extension for interoperability purposes.</p>
      <p>The N3 Named Graphs extension [<b>X</b>] defines a set of built-ins (used as predicates) to associate names or identifiers with cited formulas, which then become "named graphs". Moreover, each predicate has a well-defined semantics on how the named graph should be interpreted: as quoted graphs (the default N3 interpretation), a partitioning of triples within a dataset context, sets of triples with their own isolated contexts, or specifying relations between local and online graphs.</p>

	  <h3>Data Modeling</h3>
		  
		  <section id="naryrel">
			<h4>N-ary Relations</h4>
			<p>This is turning out to be more of a data modeling tutorial than anything else ..
			
			Until now, only considered binary relations between entities and/or values, such as .. Clearly, many types of relations are ternary, quaternary, or, in general, n-ary, i.e., they may contain an arbitrary number of participants. There are several ways of representing n-ary relations in RDF - these are described in [[[swbp-n-aryRelations]]].
			
			Below, we summarize options for representing n-ary relations in N3. 
			
			-- Using sets of binary relations
			In general, it is possible to convert any n-ary relation into an equivalent set of binary relations. This is an easy solution, since we already know how to represent binary relations.
			
			We will use clear examples of n-ary relations, such as the Purchase / Employment / .. example:
			First, we create a resource that represents the n-ary relation, and use a set of binary relations to link each relation participant to this newly minted resource. 
			Each binary relation is hereby given a meaningful name that represents the role the participant plays in the n-ary relation, for instance, ..
			
			This use case is described in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/#structuredproperties">original RDF Primer</a>.
			
			NOTE similar to our discussion on <a href="#bnodes">blank nodes</a>, one needs to choose whether to coin a new IRI for representing the n-ary relation, or whether to use a blank node &mdash; the same arguments apply here. 
			I.e., in case it could be useful to the n-ary relation from outside the N3 graph, an IRI should be used &mdash; else, a blank node should be used.
			
			(NOTE from a data modeling viewpoint, one can choose one of the participants as the subject of the relationship object in a statement, e.g., ..  This serves to indicate that this participant is somehow the "owner" of the relationship. 
			Examples in which the "owner" is more clear are the following: street address, body temperature, .. 
			the subject "owns" these relations - it would be awkward to include "john" as just another participant in the relationship - 
			whereas such a thing would be much more natural in the "Purchase" or "Employment" example.)
			
			But, these are more issues of data modeling than anything else, and either options are perfectly valid in N3, 
			(albeit some are clearly preferrable - as would be the case when modeling any kind of data repository)
			
			In some cases, things are more naturally described as *properties* of relations, rather than n-ary relations. 
			The body temperature, diagnosis example. 
			Nevertheless, these can be represented identically. 
			We start from the solution above, i.e., introducing an entity to represent the (in this case, binary) relation, and then linking the two participants to the relation entity. Subsequently, one uses a binary relation to attach the relation property (e.g., diagnosis probability) 
			to the relation entity: ..
			This is possible since we know that the relation entity represents the n-ary relation - hence any descriptive properties of the relation, in addition to participants in the relation, can simply be linked to the entity. 
			
			(NOTE from a data modeling perspective, there would be a clear problem if the relation entity could have multiple "subjects" - e.g., in case it is being re-used to represent the same diagnosis for multiple patients. In that case, each of the patients' 
			diagnosis probabilities would be linked to the same relation entity - and we lose the link that tells us which probability belongs to which patient. This can be seen as a kind of "fan trap".)
			
			-- Using collections
			Even more simply, we can use a collection to keep all the participants of the n-ary relation. For instance: ...
			
			A clear advantage of this approach is that it is easier and much less verbose to write down. 
			However, the roles each participant play in the n-ary relation are no longer explicated. For instance: ..
			
			What roles do X, Y and Z play in this relation? One could answer that question by having a tailored schema: ...

        <dt>Encoding considerations:</dt>
        <dd>The syntax of Notation3 is expressed over code points in Unicode [[UNICODE]]. The encoding is always UTF-8 [[UTF-8]]. Unicode code points may also be expressed using an \uXXXX (U+0000 to U+FFFF) or \UXXXXXXXX syntax (for U+10000 onwards) where X is a hexadecimal digit [0-9A-Fa-f]</dd>
        <dt>Security considerations:</dt>
        <dd>Notation3 is a general-purpose assertion language; applications may evaluate given data to infer more assertions or to dereference IRIs, invoking the security considerations of the scheme for that IRI. Note in particular, the privacy issues in [[RFC3023]] section 10 for HTTP IRIs. Data obtained from an inaccurate or malicious data source may lead to inaccurate or misleading conclusions, as well as the dereferencing of unintended IRIs. Care must be taken to align the trust in consulted resources with the sensitivity of the intended use of the data; inferences of potential medical treatments would likely require different trust than inferences for trip planning. Notation3 is used to express arbitrary application data; security considerations will vary by domain of use. Security tools and protocols applicable to text (e.g. PGP encryption, MD5 sum validation, password-protected compression) may also be used on Notation3 documents. Security/privacy protocols must be imposed which reflect the sensitivity of the embedded information. Notation3 can express data which is presented to the user, for example, RDF Schema labels. Application rendering strings retrieved from untrusted Notation3 documents must ensure that malignant strings may not be used to mislead the reader. The security considerations in the media type registration for XML ([[RFC3023]] section 10) provide additional guidance around the expression of arbitrary data and markup. Notation3 uses IRIs as term identifiers. Applications interpreting data expressed in Notation3 should address the security issues of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [[RFC3987]] Section 8, as well as Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax [[RFC3986]] Section 7. Multiple IRIs may have the same appearance. Characters in different scripts may look similar (a Cyrillic "о" may appear similar to a Latin "o"). A character followed by combining characters may have the same visual representation as another character (LATIN SMALL LETTER E followed by COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT has the same visual representation as LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE). Any person or application that is writing or interpreting data in Notation3 must take care to use the IRI that matches the intended semantics, and avoid IRIs that make look similar. Further information about matching of similar characters can be found in Unicode Security Considerations [[UNICODE-SECURITY]] and Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [[RFC3987]] Section 8.</dd>
