Gets the member of a list at a given position (where the position of the first element is 1)

**schema**:
`(($a_1 .. $a_n) $a_i) list:memberAt $a_m.`

Iff  `($a_1 .. $a_n)` has an element at position `$a_i`,
and if that element and `$a_m` can unify.

**requires**:
`$a_i` or `$a_m` (or both) must be bound.

Note that if `$a_i` is a variable, this builtin may bind it to more than one value
(e.g. `((“A” “B” “A”) ?i) list:memberAt "A"`).

**literal domains**:

* `$a_1 .. $a_n`, `$a_m`: unconstrained
* `$a_i`: `xs:decimal`, `xs:float`, `xs:double` within the value space of `xs:integer`
  (see also note on type promotion and substitution).
I.e., in case the double/float/decimal's literal's value is within the value space of integers,
the literal will match the domain.
In case of a negative integer, the index will count backwards from the length of the list.
